abstract={This paper introduces Chanakya, an attempt to use tools and techniques from formal methods to automatically design and analyze
game-theoretic models of strategic multiagent interactions. Here,
we discuss two problems of automatic characterization of a game
under a given notion of rationality. First, we show how tools from
automata theory can be used to completely characterize the set of
Nash equilibria of infinitely repeated games. Second, we show how
to use the theory of vector addition systems in the characterization
of evolutionary stability of evolutionary games.}
