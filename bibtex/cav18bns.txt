abstract={Asynchronous interactions are ubiquitous in computing systems
and complicate design and programming. Automatic construction
of asynchronous programs from specifications (“synthesis”) could ease
the difficulty, but known methods are complex, and intractable in practice.
This work develops substantially simpler synthesis methods. A direct,
exponentially more compact automaton construction is formulated
for the reduction of asynchronous to synchronous synthesis. Experiments
with a prototype implementation of the new method demonstrate practical
feasibility. Furthermore, it is shown that for several useful classes
of temporal properties, automaton-based methods can be avoided altogether
and replaced with simpler Boolean constraint solving.}
