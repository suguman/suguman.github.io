<li><span class = "timestamp">(Mon - Fri) January 10-14, 2022</span> One screening interview each day of the week.  Recovered from last week by establishing a <b>System</b>. The System inlcudes: <ul> <li>Spend 4-5 hrs in preparation for each interview. Emphasized on preparing about the university and the interviewers than my own research. </li> <li>Asked for list of interviewers well in advance. Prepared notes and talking points with everyone. These notes were resourceful during the full interviews also. </li> <li> Prepared answers for the standard screening interview questions: Current and Future reserach, teaching interests at undergraduate and graduate level, new courses, collaborations, why university X. </li> </li> Prepared questions for the intervierews: Graduate student policies and requirements, junior faculty mentorship, compute resources, department growth plans. Asking the same questions at all places helped me gauge universities against each other. </li> <li> Write notes about interview experience and observations immediately after each interview. These notes proved useful during final decision stages. </li>  <li> Block an hour before and after the interview. </li> <li> Keep water, coffee, and munchies within reach. </li> <ul> All screening interviews went very well. Out of this week, I was invited for the full interview by all but one place.  </li><br>
